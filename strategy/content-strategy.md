# BabySees: Content Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**Premise:** Young brains (2-4 years) are pattern-recognition engines hungry for complexity, not simplicity. Exposure to rich visual stimuli and sophisticated vocabulary builds neural pathways that "dumbed-down" content cannot.

**Goal:** Expand visual and conceptual intelligence through wonder.

---

## Design Principles

1. **High Visual Impact** — Images must arrest attention. Vivid colors, intricate patterns, dramatic compositions.
2. **Real Over Cartoon** — Photographs and art preferred over illustrations. The Crab Nebula itself, not a cartoon of it.
3. **One Word, One Image** — Each spread: large word + stunning visual. No clutter.
4. **Phonetic Richness** — Words should feel interesting in the mouth. "Nebula," "Chrysalis," "Obsidian."
5. **Category Balance** — Mix science, nature, art, mythology. Feed different hungers.

## Image Acquisition Strategy

### Primary Sources (Public Domain)
- **NASA Image Gallery** — nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery
- **Wikimedia Commons** — commons.wikimedia.org (filter by license)
- **Smithsonian Open Access** — si.edu/openaccess
- **NIH Image Gallery** — nih.gov (scientific imagery)
- **Metropolitan Museum** — metmuseum.org/art/collection (open access)
- **Rijksmuseum** — rijksmuseum.nl (open access)
- **Rawpixel Public Domain** — rawpixel.com/category/53/public-domain

### Secondary Sources (Creative Commons)
- **Unsplash** — unsplash.com (free license)
- **Pexels** — pexels.com (free license)
- **Flickr CC** — flickr.com/creativecommons

### Generation Needed
Items marked "Generate" will require AI image generation:
- Abstract mathematical concepts (Infinity, Atom)
- Mythology creatures in consistent style
- Some fractal visualizations

---

## Book Structure

**Target:** 48-60 pages (24-30 spreads)
**Format:** Square (10"x10") or landscape (11"x8.5")

### Suggested Sequence
1. Open with COSMOS — set the tone of wonder
2. NATURE'S WONDERS — bring it to Earth
3. MICROSCOPIC — zoom in
4. FRACTALS — patterns connect micro to macro
5. MYTHOLOGY — imagination realm
6. ART & ARCHITECTURE — human creation
7. Close with COSMOS — return to the infinite

## Success Criteria

An image makes the cut if:
- [ ] A toddler would stare at it
- [ ] An adult would frame it
- [ ] The word sounds satisfying spoken aloud
- [ ] The concept has depth to grow into

---

## Next Steps

1. Acquire public domain imagery for each category
2. Curate top candidates (3-5 per concept)
3. Identify generation gaps
4. Generate missing imagery
5. Final selection and sequencing
6. Layout and typography design
